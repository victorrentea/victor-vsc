//
// A Human Review reference is `OwnerListTest.java:49-51` — the reviewer means those three
// lines, and a caret on 49 says nothing about where the quote stops. So the bridge selects
// the range, paints it with a soft background that survives the selection moving, and
// fades every other line to 35% so the eye finds the three lines in a five-hundred-line
// class without hunting.
//
// The fade is a statement about the moment of arriving, not a mode the file is left in.
// It goes on the reader's first own move in that editor — a click, a keystroke, an edit —
// when another text editor becomes the active one, and when the next reference is opened
// (one focus at a time, replaced, never stacked). Focus moving to the review page itself
// (a webview, so no text editor is active) keeps it: the reader is reading the page
// against the code, which is exactly when the highlight is wanted.
//
// The pure part (which lines to fade, whether a selection event is the reader's) is
// exported on its own so plain node can test it without a VS Code host.
